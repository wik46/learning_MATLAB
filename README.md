# learning_MATLAB
This contains basic scripts used to get practice in MATLAB while studying as an undergraduate.

## Goal: 
        It fasicnates me how we can use numbers to represent physical objects in space. I enjoyed my Vector Calculus class very much
        because we got to draw, study, and work with lines, planes, surfaces, and solids. We calculate the surface areas using surface integrals.
        We studied how to use various co-ordinate systems such as the rectangular, polar-, spherical, and cyllindrical co-ordinate systems.
        
        Now the motivation behind learning MATLAB is to know how to work with these objects and compute more complicated calculations using
        the powerful technology available.

## Modules
1. Plots in Matlab.
2. Basic Linear Algebra Computations.
3. Vector Calculus Examples.
